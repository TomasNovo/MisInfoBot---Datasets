and you are both taking steps to protect yourself from the virus.;
Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common reactions for people in the context of COVID-19.;
We also do not yet know how long immunity from different COVID-19 vaccines will last.;
when developing national policies:• Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks.• For children between six and 11 years of age, the decision to use a mask will vary from place to place, and will depend on several factors, such as the intensity of transmission in the area where the child lives, local norms that influence social interactions, the child's capacity to comply with the appropriate use of masks and availability of appropriate adult supervision, and other factors.;
Part of this process also involves a review of all the safety evidence by the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.;

There is no evidence that COVID-19 is transmitted by water used in food processing.;
Enhanced food safety practices at this time, such as those recommended in the Codex documents mentioned, will reduce the likelihood of contamination of foods with any pathogen and help lowering the public health burden caused by already established foodborne infections, reducing the stress on an already overburdened public health system.;
COVID-19 transmission has primarily been attributed to the direct breathing of droplets expelled by someone with COVID-19 (people may be infectious before clinical features become apparent).;
Contact tracing is thus an essential public health tool for controlling infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19.;
These trials, which include some groups at high risk for COVID-19 (certain groups like pregnant and lactating women were not included in vaccine trials), are specifically designed to identify any common side effects or other safety concerns.;

These changes are called “mutations.”;
All modern methods of contraception help to prevent pregnancy.;
Avoid touching the mask while wearing it.;
However, there are important ethical considerations that must be addressed – particularly for a new disease like COVID-19, which we do not yet fully understand and are still learning how to treat; it may be difficult for the medical community and potential volunteers to properly estimate the potential risks of participating in a COVID-19 human challenge study.;
